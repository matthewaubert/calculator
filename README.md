**ETCH-A-SKETCH**

This project was built as part of The Odin Project, Foundations: JavaScript Basics section as a final project in order to combine everything I've learned thus far to create an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

1. Understand the Problem
  Write a program with a user interface that acts as a fully-functional on-screen calculator, allowing the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

  Extra credit:
  • Allow the calculator to return floating point numbers if the required math is inputted by the user. Allow the user to input decimals as well.
  • Make it look nice using CSS
  • Add a "backspace" button
  • Add keyboard support

2. Plan
  • Does the program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?
    This program will have a user interface that looks like a calculator app. The user should be able to click the buttons or type on the keyboard to perform operations.

  • What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    The user will provide input from clicked buttons or keyboard clicks. These actions will input numbers, perform operations, clear the display, or remove the last input.

  • What's the desired output?
    A fully-functional on-screen calculator, allowing the user to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The calculator should display the results of said operations.

3. Pseudocode
  function to add two numbers
  function to subtract two numbers
  function to multiply two numbers
  function to divide two numbers

  variable: firstNum
  variable: operator
  variable: secondNum

  operation function; input: two numbers, callback: operation to perform on input numbers
